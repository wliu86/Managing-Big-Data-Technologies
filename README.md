# Managing-Big-Data-Technologies
Data management is the foundation of data-driven enterprises and a cornerstone for business analytics. Through these projects, I gained competence in practical database, data warehousing, and data management skills with emphasis on query, data modeling, ETL, and data management. I also became familiar with major elements of the big data ecosystem.
